# Kelsie McDonald

## About Me
 * I am currently enrolled in a community college to get my Associates in Software Development
       - Once I finish this Spring Term, I will be receiving my associateâ€™s degree.
 * I became interested in Software Development back in High School, when I took a Computer Science class
 * The hands-on projects that come with being a Software Developer truly captivate me
 * Thereâ€™s a unique thrill in seeing the projects I work on spring to life right at my fingertips

I have been currently been working on a website for a construction company, with a team. So far, I made contributions to the photo carousel 
on the home page and worked on the photo index viewing page a little bit. The link below will take you to the github repository of where I
